Learning how to use GitHub

I have been using GitHub some time now, but I'm wondering if there's something else I should know.
I use a desktop version of GitHub mostly, so this internet-version of it is not so familiar to me.
I think I should understand it better - there are a lots of thing I should uderstand better at this point.
